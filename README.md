# Darts
<h2>The program helps you to play Darts, calculating scores for you. Who will be able to clear the bonus faster and win the game? Run and find out!</h2>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
One day I thought, that would be nice to write a program, that consider the points for Darts - players that would be saving a lot of time and nerves. Then I made a prototype. Now I decided to return to the project and finish it. Expect further migration to the platform Angular2 as a single-page web application. And now look at the code and enjoy.
